# milidt /ˈmɪlaɪt/

What is life? It's too profound. Let's break it down with calculus. Life can be seen as a series of integrals:

<!-- e is kind of like t -->
<!-- how to write f like d? -->

$$
\text{life} = \int i \cdot \text{f}e
$$

What is "ife"? I think time is the most crucial part. As for "i", that's up to our imagination:

$$
\text{lidt} = \int i \text{d}t 
$$

How does it come to life? People always make the best choices:

$$
\text{milidt} = \min \int i \text{d}t
$$
